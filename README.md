# Redis Perf

This is a Go-based project designed to evaluate the performance, consistency, and memory management of Redis. It supports three main scenarios:
1. High-throughput data processing
2. Consistency and failover testing
3. TTL expiration and memory management

## Features

### 1. High-Throughput Data Processing
- **Description:** Measures Redis throughput by processing large volumes of `SET` and `GET` requests.
- **Usage:** Runs bulk requests to analyze transactions per second (TPS) and response latency.

### 2. Consistency & Failover Testing
- **Description:** Tests Redis data consistency during simulated failover events.
- **Usage:** Simulates master node failure, verifies if data is correctly available after failover.

### 3. TTL Expiration & Memory Management
- **Description:** Evaluates Redis key expiration and memory management, verifying `EXPIRE` behavior and `maxmemory-policy`.
- **Usage:** Assigns different TTL values to keys and checks for correct data expiry.

## Installation

Clone the repository and build the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/esperar/redis-perf.git
cd redis-perf
make
```

Hereâ€™s the Redis cluster setup guide in English, formatted using Markdown:

## Redis Cluster Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up a Redis cluster using Docker Compose. The cluster consists of 1 master node and 2 replica nodes.

## 1. Run Docker Compose

Navigate to the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located in your terminal, and run the following command to start the Redis cluster:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## 2. Check Cluster Status

To check the status of the Redis cluster, run the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it <master_container_id> redis-cli -p 6379 cluster info
```

Replace `<master_container_id>` with the actual container ID of the master node.

## 3. Check Nodes

To view information about all nodes, use the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it <master_container_id> redis-cli -p 6379 cluster nodes
```

## 4. Stop the Cluster

To stop the cluster, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This guide will help you easily set up and manage a Redis cluster.

## Configuration

Set up Redis and configure as needed in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
redis:
  address: "localhost:6379"
  password: ""         # Redis password if set
  db: 0                # Database index
  maxMemoryPolicy: "allkeys-lru"  # Redis eviction policy for TTL tests
test:
  throughputRequests: 10000       # Number of requests for throughput test
  ttlExpiration: [5, 10, 20]      # TTL values in seconds for keys
  failoverSimulation: true        # Enable failover testing
```

## Usage

Each test can be executed independently by using Restful API
```bash
GET /failover
GET /throughput
GET /ttl
```

## Example Output

```
Throughput Test:
    Transactions/sec: 35,000
    Average latency: 1.2ms

Failover Test:
    Failover triggered. Data consistency verified.

TTL Expiration Test:
    Key TTLs expired correctly. Maxmemory-policy enforced.
```

## Requirements

- Redis server (locally or remotely accessible)
- Go 1.18 or later
